## üèÜ Project Overview

**SmartApply** is an AI-powered automation tool that revolutionizes the job application process. It leverages advanced AI agents, LLMs, and robust data pipelines to:
- Auto-fill hundreds of job applications in minutes.
- Intelligently match your resume to job descriptions.
- Tailor every application and cover letter for maximum impact.
- Integrate seamlessly with your data (resume, LinkedIn, custom profiles).
- Track, log, and analyze your application journey.

> **Problem Solved:** Manual job applications are time-consuming, repetitive, and often generic. SmartApply automates and personalizes this process, saving you 100+ hours and dramatically increasing your interview rate.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:**  
> 
> This project is intended for educational purposes and is under active development. Additional enhancements are needed to ensure full compliance with LinkedIn and other job board policies.
> 
> Please carefully review each application before submitting to guarantee accuracy and adherence to job board requirements.

**Components:**
- **Data Ingestion:** Parses user profile data (resume, LinkedIn, etc.)
- **Job Scraper:** Collects job descriptions from boards/platforms (Selenium-based)
- **AI Agent:** Uses LLMs (LangChain, Gemini, etc.) for smart matching and content generation
- **Form Filler:** Automates form filling and submission
- **Logging & Analytics:** Tracks every application for review and improvement

> See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a deep dive.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Profile Ingestion:** Add your resume/LinkedIn data to `/src/data/`.
2. **Job Collection:** Scrape or import job listings from your target platforms.
3. **AI Matching:** LLMs analyze both your profile and job descriptions to generate tailored responses.
4. **Automated Application:** The system fills and submits applications at scale, handling complex workflows.
5. **Tracking:** Every application is logged for transparency and analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Chrome browser (for Selenium automation)
- [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/) (for LLM features)

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-autoapply.git
cd job-autoapply
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Add your resume/profile data to `src/data/`.
2. Set up your `.env` file with required credentials (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)).
3. Start the Chrome debugger:  
   `sh src/scripts/start_chrome_debugger.sh`
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/main_collect.py   # Collect jobs
   python src/scripts/main_apply.py     # Auto-apply to jobs
   ```
