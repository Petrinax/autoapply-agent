About Sundial

Sundial is a top VC-backed early-stage startup headquartered at San Francisco Bay Area, US with a second office in Bengaluru, India. We have raised $23M to build the analytics platform for the AI era. Our founders are industry veterans Chandra Narayanan, previously Chief Data Scientist at Sequoia Capital, and Julie Zhuo, previously VP, Design and Research at Facebook, author of a bestselling management book. We are a small team of top talent, high caliber Engineers, Data Scientists, Designers and PM (currently 49 in India, 5 in US) and rapidly growing.




We are on a mission to help builders make meaningful use of data to fulfill their vision. Sundial automatically diagnoses a product's data to explain the ""what"" and the ""why"" to enable faster and better decision making.




Now Pull up a chair! We're excited to tell you more about our vision for Sundial! By now, you've probably visited our website and maybe our LinkedIn page and browsed around the profiles of our team members. If you haven't yet, please take a moment to do so. We'll wait 




Okay, now you know at a high level that we are focused on data storytelling. The data space has over $100B in market opportunity ahead of it, and modern Business Intelligence tools are growing at over 15% year over year.We've seen this evolution firsthand. Our co-founders Chandra Narayanan and Julie Zhuo cut their teeth scaling Facebook from a few million college students to billions of people.




To make the best decisions possible, companies are investing more and more into understanding their data. And yet, demand far outpaces supply for Data Scientists and Data Platform Engineers who can construct useful narratives out of the growing firehose of raw data, tables and charts. Currently most data-centric organizations have a large Data Platform and Data Science team that builds Big Data Platforms, Insights Data stores to bring data into dashboards and manually generates reports to communicate the product story broadly. But a large part of this process can be easily productised.




At Sundial, we're building a Sundials Insights Data Platform. This platform converts raw data in large Data Warehouses into a universe of deep product insights that product teamsincluding PMs, data scientists, executives and engineersconsume easily. This involves Highly Scalable, Robust Distributed Data Platform which can consistently, repeatably run complex Data Science and Transformation algorithms at Cloud Scale.




We envision a future where every organization becomes a data-informed organization through our work of:

Productising the diagnostic analysis of yesterday so teams can focus on the strategic bets for tomorrow.
Making data understanding easy and accessible to everyone, not just data scientists.
Surfacing opportunities of improvement in growth across segments

We believe better usage of data leads to better products, and better products lead to better experiences for people.




Responsibilities:

Sundials Big Data Ingestion and Processing System and Sundials Datalakehouse which stores the Metric, Entity and Event Stores.
You will work on Big Data technologies like Spark, Athena, Delta Lake, Cloud Data Warehouses etc.
Building out Sundials Petabyte Scale Data Processing systems, No-Code / Low-Code Transformation systems etc.
Building the Analytics-as-a-Platform engine that runs novel algorithms and frameworks through transforming clients data to Sundial Data Models.
Building out Sundials SaaS Data Platform in Public Cloud.
Work with customers and data scientists to understand the data gaps and expand the Analytics Model
Designing and building systems and features from scratch at rapid pace and high quality.




Requirements:

Strong Software Engineering fundamentals, Computer Science fundamentals, coding and design capabilities. Minimum 3-5 years of experience working in Data Platform.
Experience building Data Platforms, Data Engineering and Distributed Systems / Products for Analytics and Data-Science products.
Familiarity with big data processing engines like Spark, Athena, and popular Cloud Datawarehouses and Datalakes.
Familiarity with building backend systems and services for SaaS products in the Cloud using Cloud services. We use EMR, EKS, RDS, Opensearch, etc.
Experience working with various languages like Python, Golang, Pyspark, SQL etc.
A Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or work experience in related field.
Have prior experience working in a fast pace start up environment.




You will probably like working with us if:

You like the ownership, camaraderie and chaos of a start-up environment - Start-ups are not right for everyone. Things move quickly and change frequently. Start-ups haven't ""made it"" yet. We have to convince customers we are valuable enough to them. We must be scrappy and flexible. Everyone will wear lots of hats. But: if you have future aspirations of being an entrepreneur or leader, you'll find few better learning grounds. You'll learn by doing. You'll be given a ton of trust and responsibility. You'll see very transparently how we operate and make decisions. Your work will absolutely matter to the success of our company.
You value learning and have a growth mindset - Sundial is founded on the idea that slope is far more important than intercept. We are a learning environment, and all of us have something to teach and learn from each other. We invest heavily in learning sessions, sharing insights, and reflecting on our growth.
You're interested in understanding how companies grow, and how data plays a role - Unlocking the secrets of data is our bread and butter. How do successful companies grow? How do different types of businesses create value for users in an economically scalable way? If you find this area to be as fascinating as we do, that's awesome, because you're going to become an expert in this domain. :)




Benefits:

About ZET: 




At ZET, we believe that passion fuels those who shape the world. Our team is on a mission to make a real impact by driving financial inclusion and accessibility across Bharat. With over 500 million online users in underserved regions, we are building an ecosystem that connects consumers to trusted financial solutions that were once out of reach. Empowered by technology and trust, we are making financial services more affordable and within reach for the next billion Indians.

Through our ZET platform (B2C), we focus on empowering individuals, especially those new to credit (NTC) or with low credit scores, to build and improve their CIBIL scores. One of our key offerings is the Magnet FD Credit Card, co-branded with SBM. The Magnet card plays a pivotal role in helping users from Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities boost their credit scores. By providing insights & solutions into their creditworthiness, consumers are empowered to make informed financial decisions, unlocking opportunities for loans, mortgages and greater financial stability.

On our ZET Partner (B2B) platform, we connect communities in Tier 3 and 4 cities to a wide network of financial brands and credit products. By leveraging a trusted network of agents, we bridge the gap between consumers and top banks, making financial services more accessible and tailored to the specific needs of these underserved markets. 

Raising $13M in our series A funding in March 2022, we are proud to be backed by General Catalyst, Nexus, Sequoia Surge, Waterbridge and other leading Angel Investors. Starting with only two in 2019, we are now a workforce of high spirited people diligently striving to enable fintech for Bharat.







Problems we are solving




Lack of Awareness: Many consumers, especially those in Tier 3/4 cities, are unaware of how to improve their CIBIL score and the credit solutions available for the same.
Reaching Bharat: Consumers in Tier 3 & 4 cities often struggle to access essential financial services and opportunities due to limited reach and availability from financial institutions and banks.
Trust: The trust deficit in rural areas hinders the adoption of modern fintech solutions, creating barriers to financial inclusion.







The rise of ZET




April 2019, Founded by Manish Shara & Yash Desai
August, 2020, Raised Seed Funding led by Waterbridge Ventures
July 2021, Raised $5 M led by Sequoias Surge, Nexus Venture Partners & renowned Angel investors.
