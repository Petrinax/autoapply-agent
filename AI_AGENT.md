# ü§ñ AI Agent System in SmartApply

## Overview
SmartApply leverages advanced AI agents powered by LLMs (LangChain, Gemini, etc.) to automate and personalize the job application process.

---

## üß© Components
- **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully crafted prompts maximize the relevance and brevity of generated answers for job forms.
- **LLM Orchestration:** Integrates with LangChain and Google Gemini APIs for flexible, scalable AI workflows.
- **Form Filling Logic:** Dynamically generates answers for each form field based on job description and user profile.
- **Job Fit Scoring:** Uses LLMs to score how well a user's profile matches a job (1-10 scale), enabling smart filtering.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Input:** User profile and job description are fed to the AI agent.
2. **Prompt Generation:** Custom system prompts guide the LLM to generate concise, relevant answers.
3. **Answer Validation:** Outputs are validated against expected formats (using Pydantic models).
4. **Form Filling:** Answers are mapped to form fields and submitted automatically.
5. **Scoring:** The agent provides a match score for each job, helping prioritize applications.

## üß† Adaptability
- **Context Awareness:** The agent adapts answers based on both the job description and the user's resume.
- **Role-Specific Logic:** Prompts and answer formats can be tuned for different job types or industries.
- **Error Handling:** If the LLM output is invalid, the agent retries with improved prompts.
